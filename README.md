The following project is WIP. 

The program is used to demonstrate a heat map showing the average landvalue per SQM. 
By webcrawling publically available property data pertaining to a certain area we are able to exptrapolate that value into and average land value per region. where we can develop a valuation map to visually depict economic data that we would want. 

NOTES:
Web crawl for property data, format data
Depict data visual using any python modules (to be researched)
- dasymetric
- heatmap
- space time cubes
- voronoi diagram
Modules:
ipyleaflet

DATA COLLECTION:
Data is collected for every area in gauteng, and sorted into their general area per csv

by looking at p24 when under gauteng all the prop listings for the area are shown to a rough total of 50000
